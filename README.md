# CareerFoundry Project: SQL
A project utilizing PostgreSQL to analyze and derive insights for a fictional movie rental company, Rockbuster Stealth.  This repository serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in advanced SQL querying, focusing on complex joins, subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs). The SQL scripts provided here highlight my ability to manipulate and extract insights from relational databases effectively.

## Objective:
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions, and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy.

## Data:
The dataset for the project was a relational database made up of 15 tables.  There are tables for customer data, actor information, film details, rental records, inventory records, etc.  You can view the description of each table and the Entity Relationship Diagram via the Data Dictionary in this repo.

The project concluded with a presentation created within Tableau, with visualizations created from the Exploratory Data Analysis process.  To view the story on Tableu, [Click Here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/steven.so2767/viz/CFExercise2_9/StoryBoard)

## Tools:
- **Language:** PostgreSQL

- **Software:** pgAdmin, DbVisualizer, Tableau, Excel

## Skills Demonstrated:

- **Data Cleaning:** Removal of duplicate entries and redundant or unnecessary columns/categories.  Addressed missing values and imputed necessary data.

- **Joining Tables:** Demonstrates my expertise in performing the optimal joins for queries, to combine data from multiple tables based on common columns.

- **Subqueries:** Showcases the use of subqueries to create temporary datasets for complex analysis, filtering, and data manipulation tasks.

- **Common Table Expressions (CTE):** Illustrates my skill in using CTEs to simplify complex queries, improve code readability, and create temporary result sets.

- **Dashboard Building:** The previously provided link will provide you with a Tableau Story, containing Dashboards I created for this project. These visualizations showcase my skills in data storytelling, presenting complex insights in a visually compelling and accessible manner.
