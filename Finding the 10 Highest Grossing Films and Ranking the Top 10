Utilizing a sub-query to use the DENSE_RANK window function in conjunction with the WHERE clause.

The issue: WHERE clause cannot have a window function within it, nor can it reference an alias.

The solution: Perform the ranking window function within a sub-query and then use the WHERE clause when pulling results from that sub-query as a temp table.
